	   <h1>Michael Olivier</h1>
	   <h2>Introduction</h2>
	   <p>My name is Michael Olivier. I am a senior at Old Dominion University. My major is Information Systems & Technlogy with a concentration in E-Business and E-Commerce. I live in Hampton Roads in Virginia. I am married and have two kids. After this summer semester I will have the fall semester left and then I graduate. I am really excited about finally completing my undergrad! Professionally I have a logistics background. But I have always been drawn to electronics and technology. My plan after college is to apply for a position at a company like Amazon as a cloud practitioner. If that doesn't work out then I plan to apply to various logistics organizations as an IT computer specialist.</p>

	   <h3>Questions</h3>
         
	   <p>How much do you know about HTML, JavaScript, and PHP? How much do you know about databases such as MYSQL?</p>
	   <p>I'm going to be totally honest, I don't know much about any of those, other than they have something to do with building a website. HTML is the mark-up lanuage used to write websites. JavaScript is a programming language used to make websites more dynamic and interesting with graphics and interactive elements. PHP is yet another programming language used to manipulate databases. MySQL has to do with relational databases. That is as far as I know without going to the Internet.</p>

         <h3>Three of my favorite sites</h3>
	   <p>The first website is my most visited site of all time. It is the first thing I see after booting up my computer and clicking on the Chrome web browser.

	   <p>I love BestBuy not only for their deals but for their friendly staff and the fact that I can walk in to any one of their stores and feel like I'm in a candy store.

         <p>Whatever I can't find anywhere else, I can go to amazon.com and find it.</p>
