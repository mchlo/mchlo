Hello and welcome to my second webpage. This will be my first attempt at using a template to build a website. My first <strong><a href="about.html">webpage</a></strong> was very difficult to write because I had little to no knowledge about HTML5, CSS, or JavaScript. Since I'm in a condensed course at my college there is very little time to absorb what I am learning. So, I Google searched a lot of terms. The syntax was really difficult to master. I often grew frustrated at how not putting a closing angled bracket '>' could end up derailing the whole webpage. But, hey it's a learning experience. Anyway, take a tour of the webpage. I hope it is refreshing and yet familiar. Have a great day!	 </div>

<h2><a href="#">This is a flower</a></h2>
<div class="articles">
This is the second paragraph of the template. I'm Not sure what to write from this point. The template had a lot of verbage about licensing in this paragraph as well as the first one. Basically, the templates are free to use, even for commercial use, which is awesome!

<img src="images/pic.jpg" alt="Example pic" style="border: 3px solid #ccc;" />
<br /><br />
I'm learning a lot from this template. For example the creators of this template use the 'div' container to write the paragraphs. I did not know that you could do that. It seems easier to stylize with CSS. The template has an accompanying CSS stylesheet which is also very interesting to study. </div>

<h2><a href="#">HyperLinks</a></h2>
<div class="articles">
The links on the right work. They are part of the homework. I followed the template for link placement in the index.html file. They are the required links that we needed to complete the homework. Thank you for checking out my webpage!
